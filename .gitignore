# Alembic
# Alembic versions should generally be committed, but if there are
# any temporary files generated by alembic, they can be added here.
# For now, assuming alembic.ini and versions are committed.

# Specific to this project
# train_data/transport_price_data.json seems like source data, so not ignoring.
# If it's generated, it should be added here.
